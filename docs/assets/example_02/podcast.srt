1
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:02,112
[Grant Sanderson] If I think of like the early days of Khan Academy

2
00:00:02,112 --> 00:00:03,834
[Grant Sanderson] and like the TED talks that you gave

3
00:00:03,834 --> 00:00:05,575
[Grant Sanderson] or the book that you wrote, there's a

4
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:10,359
[Grant Sanderson] kind of, um, there's an optimism around it and also an ambition, right?

5
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,922
[Grant Sanderson] There's like, this is, this is what the

6
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:14,503
[Grant Sanderson] world could look like, or this is what education could be.

7
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:16,486
[Grant Sanderson] And aside from that, I was like, and let's start to build it.

8
00:00:16,486 --> 00:00:18,027
[Grant Sanderson] Let's actually start to make it.

9
00:00:18,027 --> 00:00:19,309
[Grant Sanderson] Uh, like where, where is your current

10
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:21,269
[Grant Sanderson] mind when you're thinking about the next decade

11
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,446
[Grant Sanderson] or the next two decades of education?

12
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:25,126
[Sal Khan] I continue to be optimistic, although I

13
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:29,309
[Sal Khan] have, I think, a better appreciation for the complexity, not,

14
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,371
[Sal Khan] you know, including this complexity of

15
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:33,432
[Sal Khan] running an organization or multiple organizations,

16
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:37,256
[Sal Khan] but also how that interfaces with the broader world.

17
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:39,857
[Sal Khan] When I first wrote Khan Academy's mission statement, it was really,

18
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:41,219
[Sal Khan] I was just trying to fill out the

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,079
[Sal Khan] paperwork with the IRS as quickly as possible

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,161
[Sal Khan] so that I could get the not-for-profit status.

21
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:46,781
[Sal Khan] You know, it was delusional when a one

22
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,143
[Sal Khan] guy in a walk-in closet is writing

23
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:49,945
[Sal Khan] free world-class education for anyone anywhere.

24
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:51,646
[Sal Khan] And even then, I recognize it's a mission.

25
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:53,567
[Sal Khan] It's not something that you're just going to be able to like,

26
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:58,210
[Sal Khan] Solve in the next two or three years But if you fast-forward to now,

27
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,732
[Sal Khan] I think 2008 Sal who was or seven Sal who was filling out

28
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:03,694
[Sal Khan] that paperwork would have been blown away

29
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:07,477
[Sal Khan] by how far Khan Academy has gotten and

30
00:01:07,477 --> 00:01:09,899
[Sal Khan] to some degree how legitimate it's viewed and

31
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,061
[Sal Khan] And how we work with systems and how many people are using it

32
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:19,789
[Sal Khan] But 2021 Sal, myself, knows that that's nice.

33
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:22,170
[Sal Khan] 2007 Sal, I know this is getting a little weird.

34
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:26,254
[Sal Khan] But as many people are using it and

35
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:29,036
[Sal Khan] as much as we've done, we're still making

36
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:33,379
[Sal Khan] a relatively small dent relative to the overall

37
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:36,099
[Sal Khan] issue of we genuinely want billions of

38
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:40,802
[Sal Khan] people to become actualized in their lives.

39
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:43,284
[Sal Khan] And I do think that Khan Academy can

40
00:01:43,284 --> 00:01:44,724
[Sal Khan] play a role catalyzing this in terms

41
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:47,206
[Sal Khan] of the underlying philosophy around

42
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,126
[Sal Khan] mastery-based learning, personalization.

43
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:54,069
[Sal Khan] I keep coming back to it and it's, you know, every now

44
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:55,590
[Sal Khan] and then there's this temptation to say,

45
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,111
[Sal Khan] well, that's not where other people are.

46
00:01:57,111 --> 00:02:00,655
[Sal Khan] Let's tweak it a little bit to be a little bit more mainstream.

47
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,096
[Sal Khan] And then you just, but then you realize

48
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:04,879
[Sal Khan] the truth of it over and over and over again.

49
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,501
[Sal Khan] So yes, we will, we are doing things at Khan Academy

50
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,983
[Sal Khan] that help work with the traditional

51
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:12,304
[Sal Khan] workflow or traditional classroom that might

52
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:14,385
[Sal Khan] not be mastery based because there's still value

53
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,367
[Sal Khan] in using Khan Academy as a supplement

54
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,830
[Sal Khan] using it as the go-to place

55
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,455
[Sal Khan] for practice, getting immediate feedback, getting micro lessons.

56
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:23,438
[Sal Khan] So we want to make sure it's used in that way.

57
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:25,102
[Sal Khan] But we want to make sure also that

58
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:27,245
[Sal Khan] we never lose our core principle that

59
00:02:27,245 --> 00:02:30,890
[Sal Khan] the ideal is mastery-based learning, differentiation, personalization.

60
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,016
[Sal Khan] I think we have helped put it into the zeitgeist.

61
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:35,618
[Sal Khan] You hear a lot more people talking about
