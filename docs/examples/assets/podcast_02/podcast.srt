1
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,480
[Grant Sanderson] if i think of like the early days of

2
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,400
[Grant Sanderson] khan academy and like the ted talks that

3
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,360
[Grant Sanderson] you gave or

4
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,960
[Grant Sanderson] the book that you wrote there's a kind

5
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,720
[Grant Sanderson] of um

6
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
[Grant Sanderson] there's an optimism around it and also

7
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,400
[Grant Sanderson] an ambition right there's like this is

8
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,919
[Grant Sanderson] this is what the world could look like

9
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,520
[Grant Sanderson] or this is what education could be

10
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,039
[Grant Sanderson] and aside from that i was like and let's

11
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,240
[Grant Sanderson] start to build it let's actually start

12
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,960
[Grant Sanderson] to make it

13
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,640
[Grant Sanderson] uh like where where is your current mind

14
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,000
[Grant Sanderson] when you're thinking about the next

15
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,360
[Grant Sanderson] decade or the next two decades of

16
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,320
[Grant Sanderson] education

17
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,240
[Sal Khan] i continue to be optimistic although i

18
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,480
[Sal Khan] have i think a better appreciation for

19
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,159
[Sal Khan] the complexity

20
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,200
[Sal Khan] not you know including just the

21
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
[Sal Khan] complexity of of of running an

22
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,559
[Sal Khan] organization or multiple organizations

23
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,280
[Sal Khan] but also

24
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,960
[Sal Khan] how that interfaces with the broader

25
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,320
[Sal Khan] with the broader world

26
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,840
[Sal Khan] when i first wrote khan academy's

27
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,360
[Sal Khan] mission statement it was really

28
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,320
[Sal Khan] i was just trying to fill out the

29
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
[Sal Khan] paperwork with the irs as quickly as

30
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,880
[Sal Khan] possible so i could get the

41
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,240
[Sal Khan] not-for-profit status

42
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,840
[Sal Khan] you know it was delusional when a one

43
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,440
[Sal Khan] guy in a walk-in closet is writing free

44
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,720
[Sal Khan] world-class education for anyone

45
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,240
[Sal Khan] anywhere and even then i recognize it's

46
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,600
[Sal Khan] a mission it's not something you're just

47
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,720
[Sal Khan] going to be able to like

48
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,679
[Sal Khan] solve in the next two or three years but

49
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,280
[Sal Khan] if you fast forward to now

50
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,240
[Sal Khan] i think 2008 sal who was or seven sal

51
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,679
[Sal Khan] who was filling out that paperwork

52
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,480
[Sal Khan] would have been blown away by how far

53
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,559
[Sal Khan] khan academy has gotten and

54
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,400
[Sal Khan] to some degree how legitimate it's

55
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
[Sal Khan] viewed and

56
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,159
[Sal Khan] and how we we work with systems and how

57
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,400
[Sal Khan] many people are using it

58
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,919
[Sal Khan] but 2021 sal myself

59
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,480
[Sal Khan] knows that that's nice 2007 sal i know

60
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,240
[Sal Khan] this is getting a little weird

61
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,360
[Sal Khan] but but as many people are using it and

62
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,720
[Sal Khan] as much as we've done

63
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,520
[Sal Khan] we're still making a relatively small

64
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:09,919
[Sal Khan] dent

65
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,280
[Sal Khan] relative to the overall issue of

66
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,679
[Sal Khan] we generally want billions of people to

67
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,280
[Sal Khan] become actualized

68
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,480
[Sal Khan] to become actualized in their lives and

69
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,559
[Sal Khan] i do think that khan academy can play a

70
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,640
[Sal Khan] role catalyzing this in terms of the

71
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,799
[Sal Khan] the underlying philosophy around mastery

72
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,360
[Sal Khan] based learning personalization

73
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,240
[Sal Khan] i keep coming back to it and it's be it

74
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,799
[Sal Khan] you know

75
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,919
[Sal Khan] every now and then there's this

76
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,440
[Sal Khan] temptation to say well that's not where

77
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,240
[Sal Khan] other people are

78
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,000
[Sal Khan] let's tweak it a little bit to be a

79
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
[Sal Khan] little bit more mainstream

80
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
[Sal Khan] and then you just but then you realize

81
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,760
[Sal Khan] the truth of it over and over and over

82
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,520
[Sal Khan] again so yes we will we are doing things

83
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,640
[Sal Khan] at khan academy

84
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,120
[Sal Khan] that help work with a traditional

85
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,200
[Sal Khan] workflow or a traditional classroom that

86
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,640
[Sal Khan] might not be mastery based because

87
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,919
[Sal Khan] there's still value in

88
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,640
[Sal Khan] using khan academy as a supplement using

89
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,120
[Sal Khan] it

90
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,799
[Sal Khan] as the go-to place for practice getting

91
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,559
[Sal Khan] immediate feedback getting micro lessons

92
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,760
[Sal Khan] so we want to make sure it's used in

93
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,480
[Sal Khan] that way

94
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,320
[Sal Khan] but we want to make sure also that we

95
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,559
[Sal Khan] never lose our core principle that the

96
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,159
[Sal Khan] ideal is mastery based learning

97
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,000
[Sal Khan] differentiation personalization

98
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,240
[Sal Khan] i think we have helped put it into the

99
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,039
[Sal Khan] zeitgeist

100
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,200
[Sal Khan] you hear a lot more people talking about
