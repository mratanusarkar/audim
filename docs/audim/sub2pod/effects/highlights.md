# Highlights

Highlight effects allow you to create highlight effects to elements within the video frames.
It is useful when you want to create a highlight effect to an element, or a group of elements or sections of area within the frame.

As of now, the following highlight effects are available:

- `none`: No highlight (default)
- `pulse`: Pulsing highlight
- `glow`: Glowing highlight
- `box`: Box highlight
- `underline`: Underline highlight

Below is the API documentation for the highlight effects:
