# Transitions

Transition effects allow you to create transition effects to elements in the video frames or the frames themselves.
It is useful when you want to create a smooth transition between two different scenes or frames, or individual elements.

As of now, the following transition effects are available:

- `none`: No transition (default)
- `fade`: Fade-in transition
- `slide`: Slide-in transition

Below is the API documentation for the transition effects:
