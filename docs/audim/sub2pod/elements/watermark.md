# Watermark

The watermark element is a component that is used to display the watermark text at the bottom of the video frame.

This is useful for branding and attribution. We can have the following texts as a watermark for Audim:

1. "made with ❤️ by audim" (_default_)
2. "made with ❤️ and audim"
3. "created with ❤️ by audim"
4. "made with audim"
5. "created with audim"
6. "generated with audim"
7. or any custom text attributing to "Audim"


Below is the API documentation for the watermark element:
