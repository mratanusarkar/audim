# Core (Video Generation Module)

The core module is the main **Video Generation Engine**.
It is responsible for the overall structure and flow of the podcast video.

It uses a **layout object** to define the visual arrangement of the video,
which internally uses a collection of **elements** and their **effects** to define the _components_ of each frame in the video and their _animations and transitions_.

Below is the API documentation for the core module:
