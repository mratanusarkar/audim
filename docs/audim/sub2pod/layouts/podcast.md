# Podcast Layout

The podcast layout is designed to create dynamic scenes for the podcast.

Typically, it features:

- profile pictures of the speakers (which are highlighted when they are speaking)
- text dialogues of the speakers (which is displayed in real-time as they speak)

Below is the API documentation for the podcast layout:
