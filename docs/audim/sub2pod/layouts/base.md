# Base Layout

The base layout sets the base layout for the podcast.

It must be overriden to create various layout structures placing various elements in different places in the scenes.
This would determine how the video frames would look like in the podcast.

A Layout is defined by a collection of **elements** and their positions and placements in a video frame with their **effects**.
It defines the _components_ of each frame in the video and their _animations and transitions_.

Below is the API documentation for the base layout:
