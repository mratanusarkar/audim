!!! info
    This is the first release of Audim.

Putting everything together, all the modules, small changes and everything we have developed so far into one place, let's take a look how Audim generates the podcast video.

## Overview

For this example, we'll transform a conversation between Grant Sanderson (from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)) and Sal Khan (from [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)) into a visually engaging podcast video. We'll walk through:

1. Preparing the input files
2. Extracting the audio from the video
3. Generating a transcript from the audio
4. Setting up the podcast layout
5. Generating the video with **Audim**
6. Reviewing the final output


## Step 00: Setup

- We have setup the project and installed the dependencies.
- We have downloaded the video podcast from the youtube link above.
- 19:39 - The next decades of education


## Step 01: Prepare the input files

- We have downloaded [this video podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAhKohb5e_w&t=1179s) from YouTube for demo purposes.
  > PS: you will have your own recordings when you use for your own podcast video generation.
- Since the video is too long for just a demo, we will only use the [19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAhKohb5e_w&t=1179s) - "_The next decades of education_" part.
- other than the video, we need a podcast brand logo, and profile images for the speakers. I have used the following images from google:
    - [3b1b Logo](/assets/example_03/logo.png)
    - [Grant Sanderson](/assets/example_03/grant.png)
    - [Sal Khan](/assets/example_03/sal.png)


## Step 02: Extract the audio from the video

- We have extracted the audio from the video using Audim's `extract` module.
- see [docs/audim/utils/extract.md](../audim/utils/extract.md) API docs for more details.
- see blog [v0.0.6](./v0.0.6.md) for more details on how to extract the audio from a video file.

**Note:** Incase you had an audio recording instead of a video, you could have skipped step 02 and used the audio file directly in step 03.

Here's the audio file we have extracted:

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <audio controls style="width: 100%;">
    <source src="/assets/example_03/podcast.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 5px;">extracted audio snippet from the downloaded youtube video</p>
</div>


## Step 03: Generate a transcript from the audio

- We have generated a transcript from the audio using Audim's `aud2sub` module.
- see [Podcast Transcriber](../audim/aud2sub/transcribers/podcast.md) API docs for more details.
- see blog [v0.0.5](./v0.0.5.md) for more details on how to generate a transcript from an audio file.

**Note:** Incase you had a transcript instead of an audio file, you could have skipped step 03 and used the transcript directly in step 04.

Here's the transcript we have generated:

<div style="max-height: 400px; overflow: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">
    <pre id="srt-container"></pre>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 5px;">transcript generated from the audio snippet</p>
</div>

<script>
fetch("/assets/example_03/podcast.srt")
.then(response => response.text())
.then(text => {
    document.getElementById("srt-container").textContent = text;
})
.catch(error => console.error("Error loading subtitles:", error));
</script>


## Step 04: Set up the podcast layout

- We have set up the podcast layout using Audim's `sub2pod` module.
- see [Podcast Layout](../audim/sub2pod/layouts/podcast.md) API docs for more details.
- see blog [v0.0.2](./v0.0.2.md) for more details on how to set up the podcast layout.
- also, see blog [v0.0.3](./v0.0.3.md) for the design philosophy behind the podcast layout, and some more variations on the podcast layout.


## Step 05: Generate the video

- We have generated the video using Audim's `sub2pod` module.
- see [VideoGenerator](../audim/sub2pod/core.md) API docs for more details.
- see blog [v0.0.2](./v0.0.2.md) for more details on how to generate a video from a transcript.


## Step 06: Review the final output

Here's the final output video we have generated:

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <video controls style="width: 100%;">
    <source src="/assets/example_03/podcast.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video element.
  </video>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 5px;">final podcast video generated from the input content</p>
</div>
