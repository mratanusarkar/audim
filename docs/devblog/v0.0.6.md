This guide introduces Audim's new `Extract` utility for seamlessly extracting high-quality audio from video files. This simple yet powerful feature streamlines the podcast production workflow by eliminating the need for external tools, and can be used in various other use cases and scenarios in the podcast production workflow.

## Overview

The `Extract` utility provides a clean interface for:

1. **Video-to-Audio Conversion**: Extract audio from podcast videos
2. **Format Flexibility**: Support for WAV, MP3, FLAC, and other formats
3. **Quality Control**: Configurable bitrate and sample rate

## Basic Usage

Extracting audio from a video file is straightforward:

```python
from audim.utils.extract import Extract

# Set input and output file paths
input_file = "./input/podcast.mp4"
output_file = "./output/podcast.wav"
output_format = "wav"

# Extract audio from video
extractor = Extract()
extractor.extract_audio(input_file, output_file, output_format)
```

## Advanced Options

For more control over the extraction process:

```python
from audim.utils.extract import Extract

extractor = Extract()
extractor.extract_audio(
    input_path="./input/podcast.mp4",
    output_path="./output/podcast.mp3",
    output_format="mp3",
    bitrate="320k",
    sample_rate=48000
)
```

## Integration with Audim Workflow

This utility complements the existing Audim modules:

1. **Extract audio** from your recorded video using `Extract.extract_audio()`
2. **Generate subtitles** with `aud2sub` from the extracted audio (see [Podcast Subtitling](./v0.0.5.md))
3. **Produce podcasts** with `sub2pod` from the extracted audio and generated subtitles (see [Podcast Videos](./v0.0.2.md))
